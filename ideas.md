- Floating toolbar at top for export/save functions
- Minimal visual noise, maximum focus on content

**Signature Elements:**
- Thin geometric lines connecting nodes
- Monospace font for node labels
- Subtle hover states with minimal animation

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Click-to-add nodes, drag-to-connect
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Selected Design: Playful Creative Studio

I've chosen **Approach 2: Playful Creative Studio** because it best captures the spirit of Agent Skills creation—a tool that should feel empowering, creative, and joyful to use. The vibrant colors, rounded shapes, and playful animations will make the workflow design experience feel less like technical work and more like creative expression. This approach balances professional functionality with approachability, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Soft gradient background creates visual warmth
- Colorful node types help users quickly identify different skill components
- Rounded shapes and playful animations reduce cognitive load
- Vibrant accent colors (coral, teal, gold) provide visual excitement
- Smooth interactions create a sense of fluidity and control
